## `Building the first image Docker based on NodeJS app`

For this basic project, we will use `NodeJS` application to deploy a message on the browser exposing the port to stay visible for us.

## Installation

This installation is based on LINUX Ubuntu, in this case to install please follow the steps below:

```bash
$ apt install nodejs -y
```

## Usage

Ensure you have executed the application locally using the command below:

```bash
$ node app.js
```

After this, please check on your web browser the address `http://192.168.1.100:3000/`. You can able to see the message `Ol√° MUNDO!` in portuguese.

## Build a Docker image using the nodejs image

Now we can create a `Dockerfile` to deploy the Docker image:

```dockerfile
FROM node
WORKDIR /src
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

- After this step, please proceed wth the command below:

```bash
$ docker image build -t amauryborgesouza/nginx-apps:v1 .
```

- Check if the image is listed:

```bash
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
amauryborgesouza/nginx-apps   v1        a3f7a1b38eed   5 seconds ago   999MB
```

- Now you can able to run the container:

```bash
$ docker container run -d -p 3000:3000 amauryborgesouza/nginx-apps:v1
```

- Push the image have created to Dockerhub:

```
$ docker push  amauryborgesouza/nginx-apps:v1
The push refers to repository [docker.io/amauryborgesouza/nginx-apps]
